heuristics:
    The above paper seems to be the only actual paper with 2048 heuristics.
    THey are as follows:
        
        Greedy - picks the state with the most official score. the official score is just a sum of added tiles - for instance, if 8 and 8 are added to a 16 tile, 
        a 16 would be added to the score.
        
        Empty - picks the state with the most empty tiles.
        
        Uniform - picks the state that produces the most tiles with the same value.
        
        Monotonicity - We consider a game to have high monotonicity if the values are either non-increasing along all rows or non-decreasing along all rows and if 
        the values are non-increasing along all columns or non-increasing along all columns, with the highest value being in one of the four corners.

        Random - Select randomly between the given inputs.

    In 2048, since 2 states easily can be visually different but with the same strategy, i will use multiple heuristics, and finish with the random heuristic, narrowing down the option as i calculate.
